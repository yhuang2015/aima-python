1. B Level (75):
    - myBayes.py was created. The variables snow and windChill have prior probability. noSchool and extremeWarning
        have a single parent. advisory has two parents. A dictionary named examples is defined, with the snowDay instance
        and 4 subsequent queries. The submission compiles and runs, and prints out accurate estimates, each with two Bayesian
        inferences
2. Better:
    (+5): Submit at least 4 queries that have unique paths of at least two inferences.
        - The 4 queries that are printed out when the program is run contain different inferences that will lead to unique
        paths when finding the probabilities.

75 + 5 = 80
