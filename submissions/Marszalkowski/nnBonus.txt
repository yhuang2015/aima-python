Of the C level requirements, it seems I accomplished 1.1 and 1.3. myNN.py contains a data set with at least 100 samples,
16 input values and 4 output values. There is a target set (y_train), I called for the model to be fit, tested the model
against the target, and created the example BHExample. 1.3 was the creation of this file. In 1.2, the submission compiles
and runs, but is not able to come up with successful predictions.

Bonus:
(+5) 1000+ samples (data set has 11,000 samples)
