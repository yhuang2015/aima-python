** Homework for Thursday, November 15th ****

(5) Submit a project at C level by Monday night.
    I did it!

(5) Submit at least 4 queries that have unique paths of at least two inferences.
    I have four queries that produce unique paths of at least two inferences.


(10)Explain how each variable in your model accurately corresponds to an aspect of a real-word event.
    If you use probability tables, cite statistics supporting the entries in those tables.
For this Bayesian Network, I used Lung Cancer as my theme. I mainly chose Lung Cancer because it has the least amount
of causes since it is mainly caused by Smoking and sometimes chemicals within highly polluted areas.
I did not have a probability table for this because I pulled and calculated the probabilities for several websites that I included
below.

To start, (1)Lung Cancer is a real world health factor that reflect mainly in (2)smokers, which have a probability 90%
to getting being diagnosed. In addition to this, Lung Cancer is rarely caused by high air (3)pollution, which has a probability of
10%. In addition to this, Lung Cancer leads to (4)Dyspnoea, which a very common symptom of lung cancer, and therefore has a
probability 70%. Finally, Lung Cancer has a 87% probability of leading to (5)death.

Here are some of the sources

(5N, <= 10) for any probability table actually derived from real-world data of 1000 samples or more
I think I apply for this bonus? Although I didn't find a probability table that has this exact data on in, these
probabilities are pulled from +1000 samples of different lung cancer patients. It's okay if
I don't I just didn't want to miss out on any extra points.
