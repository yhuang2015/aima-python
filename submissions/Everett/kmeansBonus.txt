    Create myKMeans.py
        Find a data set:
            At least 100 rows
            At least 3 columns.
            Each cell is a number.

            'data': tags the data set.
            'k': tags a list of K values to try.  The middle K should produce the best classification.
        for example:

        Examples = {
            'IrisClasses': {
                'data': irisData,
                'k': [2, 3, 4],
