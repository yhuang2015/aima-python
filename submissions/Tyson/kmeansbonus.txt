+75: Got a "c" level project to compile and produce a list of centers for
each k value. The dataset was about the perceived quality of wine in regard to its
chemical make-up. The last column in the dataset was the overall quality.
The others were values for things like volatile acidity, citric acid, and ph level.

+5: c-level project in by saturday.
