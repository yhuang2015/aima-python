(5) Submit at least 4 queries that have unique paths of at least two inferences.
    --> 5 queries that draw from either the heart attack branch (which has parents associated to the heart attack) or old age branch (which only feeds into the death node)

(2N, <= 10) Explain how each variable in your model accurately corresponds to an aspect of a real-word event.  If you use probability tables, cite statistics supporting the entries in those tables.
    --> every node in this network was derived from the CDC and other sources on real world age, obesity, heart attack, and death statistics
    --> 5 nodes in network

(5N, <= 10) for any probability table actually derived from real-world data of 1000 samples or more.
    --> every node is derived from statistics of the american population > 1000 samples
    --> 5 nodes in network
