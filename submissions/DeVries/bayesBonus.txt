Homework 19 Bonuses

C Level (+75):
At least two variables with prior probability - Female and LGB
At least one variable with a single parent - PrematureDeath [LungCancer is only parent]
At least one variable with two parents - Smoking[Female and LGB are the two parents]

2.3 (+5)
Query 1, P( LungCancer | 'LGB': True ), requires an inference between LGB and Smoker, and Smoker and LungCancer.
Query 2, P( LGB | 'PrematureDeath': False ), requires an inference between PrematureDeath and LungCancer, LungCancer
    and Smoker, and Smoker and LGB.
Query 3, P( PrematureDeath | 'Female': True, 'LGB': True ), requires an inference between LGB, Female, and Smoker,
    Smoking, Female and LungCancer, and LungCancer and PrematureDeath.
Query 4, P( Smoker | 'Female': False, 'PrematureDeath': True ), requires an inference between Female and Smoker, PrematureDeath
    and LungCancer, and LungCancer and Smoker.

    (+2) LGB is the percentage of American population which is Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual.
    From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States
    (+2) Female is the percentage of Americans that are female.
    From: https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-gender/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D
    (+2) Smoker is the percentage of Americans that are smokers based on gender and sexual orientation.
    Calculated from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665254/
    (+2) LungCancer is the likelihood of getting lung cancer based on smoking and gender.
    From: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-percentage-of-smokers-get-lung-cancer-2248868
    (+2) PrematureDeath is the likelihood of dying within 5 years based on having lung cancer or not.
    From: https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-cancer#life-expectancy,
    and the likelihood of dying within 5 years without lung cancer was calculated from how many Americans die prematurely each year,
    found here: https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0501-preventable-deaths.html
    subtracting the number that die from lung cancer every 5 years, found here:
    https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/resource-library/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html
    and dividing by the total population of the US.

2.5 (+10)
    (+5) The first probability table, comparing likelihood of smoking based on gender and sexual orientation, was derived from
    the data found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665254/
    which is based on over 40,000 samples.
    (+5) The second probability table, comparing likelihood of lung cancer based on gender and smoking habits, was derived from
    the statistics found here: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-percentage-of-smokers-get-lung-cancer-2248868
    which was from a study of over 2,000 lung cancer cases.
